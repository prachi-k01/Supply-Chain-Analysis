## Problem Statement 
A fast-growing fashion and beauty startup needed to evaluate and improve the efficiency of its supply chain operations. Key areas of focus included inventory optimization, supplier performance, quality control, and logistics efficiency.

  
**Tools used:** PowerBI â€¢ Excel â€¢ GitHub

## Objective
As a Business Analyst for a newly launched fashion and beauty startup, my objective was to evaluate the company's supply chain operations using a data-driven approach to:

- Identify inefficiencies in transportation and supplier performance
- Minimize operational and delivery costs
- Improve product quality and inspection turnaround
- Optimize inventory management across SKUs

### Business Questions Answered

1. Which product categories and customer segments drive the most revenue?
2. How efficient and cost-effective are our logistics and transportation modes?
3. What is the current state of product quality and manufacturing efficiency?
4. Which suppliers or locations are performing best in terms of cost, quality, and speed?
5. Are there inefficiencies in our inventory management and product movement?

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaned currency formatting (â‚¹), fixed inconsistent symbols.
- Converted data types (dates, numbers, text) correctly.
- Created key metrics:
  1. Profit, Profit Margin %, Inventory Turnover Rate
  2. Revenue per Manufacturing Day
  3. Defect Rate %, Stock/Order Quantity Ratio
- Flagged outliers (IQR method) & categorized turnover rate.
- Added stock status: Understocked, Balanced, Overstocked.
- Handled zero values, avoided divide-by-zero errors.
- Renamed columns, removed irrelevant ones, formatted as Excel Table.
